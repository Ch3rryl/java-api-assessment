# **API Development with Java & SpringBoot Assessment**

## **Introduction**
Dive into the world of API development using Java & SpringBoot. We're handing over a skeleton codebase; your challenge is to shape a top-notch API from it.

You can build any API of your choosing, but it must include the following:

1. At least one algorithm
1. Unit test at least one class
1. Store the data in a JSON file 
1. Exception handling 
1. Evidence of inheritance
1. Good use of HTTP Protocols - methods, request and response, have full CRUD operations supported 
1. Documentation

### **Learning Outcomes:**

By the end of this assessment, you should be able to:

1. **Design and Architect APIs**: Get to grips with the nitty-gritty of curating a top-quality API, focusing on data flow and endpoint interactions.
1. **Implement Best Practices**: Showcase your adherence to Java & SpringBoot coding standards, error handling, and optimal project structure.
1. **Code Integration**: Seamlessly combine your creations with the provided skeleton codebase.
1. **Exception Management**: Efficiently handle exceptions, ensuring your API remains sturdy and dependable.

Onward with this assessment, you're set for a deep dive into API development with Java & SpringBoot.

## **Design & Requirements**

### **Design Considerations:**
- **API Flow**: Map out your API's progression, from endpoints to their functionalities.

### **Requirements List:**
- **Core**: Make use of Java & SpringBoot.
- **End Points**: Ensure they are detailed and fully operational.
- **Error Handling**: Your API should handle mishaps gracefully and return informative feedback.

### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Acknowledge the pivotal role of a focused design in APIs.
- See firsthand how a detailed requirements list can pave the way for successful development.

## **Repository Management**

- **Consistent Commits**: Commit often, capturing your progress and thought process.
- **README**: Not just an afterthought. Fill it with the essence of your API, setup instructions, and other salient details.

### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Hone your skills in effective version control.
- Recognise the value of a well-curated repository.

## **Code Quality & Structure**

- **Best Practices**: Stick to Java & SpringBoot best practices and conventions.
- **Modularity**: Your code should be modular, reusable, and easily comprehensible.

#### **Learning Outcomes:**
- Craft clean, efficient, and maintainable code.
- Harness Java & SpringBoot to its fullest.
